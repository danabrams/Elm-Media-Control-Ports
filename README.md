# Elm-Media-Control-Ports

This is a proof of concept implementation for what I presented at Oslo Elm Day in 2019. 

I wouldn't use it in production yet, there's still a whopper of a design area to figure out. 

I do think this model works extremely well for audio playback, the design area is video related.
